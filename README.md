# Heart-Patient-Analysis-with-ML-Models
In this repository, we are analyzing the heart patients, and determining whether he is suffering from heart disease or not.

For this, we have compared the performance of different models:-

Mode-1--> AdaBoostClassifier

Mdoel-2--> RandomForestClassifier

Model-3-->BaseyianRidge

Model-4-->GradientBoosting


We have observed that, AdaBoostClassifeir is providing us the best results with testing_accuracy-0.97 and Metric_score=0.87
